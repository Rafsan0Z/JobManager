# JobManager
An app for managing jobs I'm looking to apply to, with various different databases, as a terminal, desktop and web application

The main branch will serve as the repo for the terminal version of the application, using a JSON database

The app can be used for the following cases:

1. Find a job posting, based on the criterion given
2. Add a job posting
3. Update a job posting
4. Sort all the postings bt the following:
     a. Wage
     b. Remote?/Hybrid?/In-Person?
     c. Distance from home
     d. Date Found
     e. Deadline (if any)
     f. Most # of skills that I have, or skills that were specified

This is an Object Oriented Project, with "Skill" and "Job" serving as Objects, more details will be provided as the app is implemented
